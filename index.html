                    Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. 
                    The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12 - 15 items that they rotate seasonally. 
                    The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.

                    Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. 
                    To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.
